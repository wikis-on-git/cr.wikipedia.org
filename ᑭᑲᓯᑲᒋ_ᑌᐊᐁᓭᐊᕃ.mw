ISBN 978-0-19-214231-3</ref> known as '''Julius Caesar''', was a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] politician, general, and notable author of [[Latin]] prose. He played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the [[Roman Republic]] and the rise of the [[Roman Empire]].

In 60 BC, Caesar, [[Marcus Licinius Crassus|Crassus]], and [[Pompey]] formed a [[First Triumvirate|political alliance]] that dominated [[Roman politics]] for several years. Their attempts to amass power as ''[[Populares]]'' were opposed by the ''[[Optimates]]'' within the [[Roman Senate]], among them [[Cato the Younger]] with the frequent support of [[Cicero]]. Caesar's victories in the [[Gallic Wars]], completed by 51&nbsp;BC, extended Rome's territory to the [[English Channel]] and the [[Rhine]]. Caesar became the first Roman general to cross both the Channel and the Rhine, when he built a [[Caesar's Rhine bridges|bridge across the Rhine]] and crossed the Channel to [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|invade Britain]].

These achievements granted him unmatched military power and threatened to eclipse the standing of Pompey, who had realigned himself with the Senate after the [[Battle of Carrhae|death of Crassus]] in 53&nbsp;BC. With the Gallic Wars concluded, the Senate ordered Caesar to step down from his military command and return to Rome. Caesar refused the order, and instead marked his defiance in 49&nbsp;BC by [[crossing the Rubicon]] with the [[Legio XIII Gemina|13th Legion]], leaving his province and illegally entering [[Roman Italy]] under arms.<ref>{{cite book|last=Keppie|first=Lawrence|title=The making of the Roman Army: from Republic to Empire|year=1998|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|location=Norman, OK|isbn=978-0-8061-3014-9|page=102|chapter=The approach of civil war}}</ref> [[Caesar's Civil War|Civil war resulted]], and Caesar's victory in the war put him in an unrivalled position of power and influence.

After assuming control of government, Caesar began a programme of social and governmental reforms, including the creation of the [[Julian calendar]]. He centralised the bureaucracy of the Republic and was eventually proclaimed "[[Dictator perpetuo|dictator in perpetuity]]", giving him additional authority. But the underlying political conflicts had not been resolved, and on the [[Ides of March]] (15&nbsp;March) 44&nbsp;BC, [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|Caesar was assassinated]] by a group of rebellious senators led by [[Marcus Junius Brutus the Younger|Marcus Junius Brutus]]. A new [[Roman civil wars#Late Republic|series of civil wars]] broke out, and the [[Constitution of the Roman Republic|constitutional government of the Republic]] was never fully restored. Caesar's adopted heir Octavian, later known as [[Augustus]], rose to sole power after defeating his opponents in the civil war. Octavian set about solidifying his power, and the era of the [[Roman Empire]] began.

Much of Caesar's life is known from his own accounts of his military campaigns, and from other contemporary sources, mainly the letters and speeches of Cicero and the historical writings of [[Sallust]]. The later biographies of Caesar by [[Suetonius]] and [[Plutarch]] are also major sources. Caesar is considered by many historians to be one of the greatest military commanders in history.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Battles That Changed History: An Encyclopedia of World Conflict|author=Tucker, Spencer|publisher= ABC-CLIO|year= 2010 |page=68}}</ref>

==Early life and career==
{{Main|Early life and career of Julius Caesar}}
[[File:Marius Glyptothek Munich 319.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Gaius Marius]], Caesar's uncle]]
Caesar was born into a [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] family, the ''[[gens]] [[Julia (gens)|Julia]]'', which claimed descent from [[Ascanius|Iulus]], son of the legendary [[Troy|Trojan]] prince [[Aeneas]], supposedly the son of the goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Froude|first=James Anthony|authorlink=James Anthony Froude|title=Life of Caesar|publisher=Project Gutenberg e-text|year=1879|page=67|url=http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext05/8cesr10.txt}} See also: Suetonius, ''[[Lives of the Twelve Caesars]]'': ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#6 6]; [[Velleius Paterculus]], ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#41 2.41]; [[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]''</ref> The ''[[cognomen]]'' "Caesar" originated, according to [[Pliny the Elder]], with an ancestor who was born by [[Caesarean section]] (from the Latin verb to cut, ''caedere'', ''caes-'').<ref>[[Pliny the Elder]], ''Natural History'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+7.7 7.7]. The misconception that Julius Caesar himself was born by Caesarian section dates back at least to the 10th century (''[[Suda]]'' [http://www.stoa.org/sol-bin/search.pl?db=REAL&search_method=QUERY&login=guest&enlogin=guest&user_list=LIST&page_num=1&field=adlerhw_gr&searchstr=kappa%2C1199 kappa 1199]). Julius wasn't the first to bear the name, and in his time the procedure was only performed on dead women, while Caesar's mother [[Aurelia Cotta|Aurelia]] lived long after he was born.</ref> The ''[[Augustan History|Historia Augusta]]'' suggests three [[Etymology of the name of Julius Caesar|alternative explanations]]: that the first Caesar had a thick head of hair (Latin ''caesaries''); that he had bright grey eyes (Latin ''oculis caesiis''); or that he killed an elephant (''caesai'' in Moorish) in battle.<ref>''[[Augustan History|Historia Augusta]]'': ''Aelius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Aelius*.html#2 2].</ref> Caesar issued coins featuring images of elephants, suggesting that he favored this interpretation of his name.

Despite their ancient pedigree, the Julii Caesares were not especially politically influential, although they had enjoyed some revival of their political fortunes in the early 1st century BC.<ref>Goldsworthy, [https://books.google.com/books?id=oR-ljeBaWIcC&pg=PA32 p. 32].</ref> Caesar's father, also called [[Gaius Julius Caesar (proconsul)|Gaius Julius Caesar]], governed the province of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]],<ref>Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#1 1]; [[Plutarch]], ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#1 1], ''Marius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Marius*.html#6 6]; Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+7.54 7.54]; ''Inscriptiones Italiae'', 13.3.51–52</ref> and his sister [[Julia (wife of Marius)|Julia]], Caesar's aunt, married [[Gaius Marius]], one of the most prominent figures in the Republic.<ref>Plutarch, Marius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Marius*.html#6 6]</ref> His mother, [[Aurelia Cotta]], came from an influential family.

In 85 BC, Caesar's father died suddenly,<ref>Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#1 1]; Pliny the Elder, ''Natural History'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plin.+Nat.+7.54 7.54]</ref> so Caesar was the head of the family at 16. His coming of age coincided with a [[Sulla's first civil war|civil war]] between his uncle Gaius Marius and his rival [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla]]. Both sides carried out bloody purges of their political opponents whenever they were in the ascendancy. Marius and his ally [[Lucius Cornelius Cinna]] were in control of the city when Caesar was nominated to be the new [[Flamen Dialis|high priest of Jupiter]],<ref>Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2A*.html#22 2.22]; Florus, ''Epitome of Roman History'' [[s:Epitome of Roman History/Book 2#9|2.9]]</ref> and he was married to Cinna's daughter [[Cornelia (wife of Caesar)|Cornelia]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.hsc.csu.edu.au/ancient_history/personalities/rome/caesar/caesar.html|title= Julius Caesar |work= |publisher= |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#1 1]; Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#1 1]; Velleius Paterculus, ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2B*.html#41 2.41]</ref> Following Sulla's final victory, though, Caesar's connections to the old regime made him a target for the new one. He was stripped of his inheritance, his wife's dowry, and his priesthood, but he refused to divorce Cornelia and was forced to go into hiding.<ref>Canfora, p. 3</ref> The threat against him was lifted by the intervention of his mother's family, which included supporters of Sulla, and the [[Vestal Virgins]]. Sulla gave in reluctantly, and is said to have declared that he saw many a Marius in Caesar.<ref name="plutsuet1" />

Caesar felt that it would be much safer far away from Sulla should the Dictator change his mind, so he left Rome and joined the army, serving under [[Marcus Minucius Thermus]] in Asia and [[Servilius Isauricus]] in Cilicia. He served with distinction, winning the [[Civic Crown]] for his part in the [[Siege of Mytilene]]. He went on a mission to [[Bithynia]] to secure the assistance of King [[Nicomedes IV of Bithynia|Nicomedes's]] fleet, but he spent so long at Nicomedes' court that rumours arose of an affair with the king, which Caesar vehemently denied for the rest of his life.<ref>Suetonius, ''Julius'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Julius*.html#2 2–3]; Plutarch, ''Caesar'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Caesar*.html#2 2–3]; [[Cassius Dio]], ''Roman History'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Cassius_Dio/43*.html#20 43.20]</ref> Ironically, the loss of his priesthood had allowed him to pursue a military career, as the high priest of Jupiter was not permitted to touch a horse, sleep three nights outside his own bed or one night outside Rome, or look upon an army.<ref>William Smith, ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities'': ''[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/secondary/SMIGRA*/Flamen.html Flamen]''</ref>
