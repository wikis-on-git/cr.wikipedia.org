I'm never going to refrain from making unconstructive edits here. You deleted my articles for Glenn Stafford, Tokuhiko Uwabo and Takahito Abe and other people and I hate you guys anyway because I already hate anybody even before I was using the Internet in 1995. I have been warned for four years in a row now to stop vandalizing Wikipedia or I will be permanently banned, but they never ban me for more than a month or so. 

I mean I don't even use a different IP or ISP.
