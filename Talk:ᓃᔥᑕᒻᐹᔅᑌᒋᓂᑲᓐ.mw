==response to standard dialect suggestion==

As far as I know there is no standardised/academic/educational Cree.  There is a standardisation process by people like Arok Wolvengrey in using SRO when writing Cree, but that is still dialect dependent.  I don't think this is the place to try and create some sort of standard, across-dialect Cree language.  As for the suggestions about 'r' and 'l'....Nehiyawewin does not have these sounds at all, so including them in the Nehiyawewin dialect would be rather bizarre.

== standard dialect? ==

Why not attempt writing articles in some form of a  standardize dialect (an academic/educational Cree) based on a middle ground, not simply one dialect or another. For example, y-dialect speakers east of james bay have had access only to l-dialect bibles and religious materials for over 100 years until they finally translated one in the local dialect. However, an l-dialect is very easy to convert into a y, n, th, or r dialect, but the reverse is not true for a y or n dialect. Elders today still use the l-dialect material without a problem. Also,  k- over palatalized ch- should be preferred since all cases of palatalization are predictable. Any idiosyncrasies found only in one dialect should be avoided, such as the vowel /e/ having changed to /aa/ in northern east cree and to /ii/ in woods cree. This would make the wikipedia articles much easier to read for all dialects.  So to recap,

we should use the letter l, r, of th over y or n (so that all the dialects can easily replace the letter)
we should use the k over palatalized -ch- since the palatized ch is always predictable
and use the vowel e as opposed to "aa" or "ii" 

For those who do not have any knowledge of where the l, k, an e go, we could agree to edit the pages to make them more comprehensible. Also, I suggested that we call the whole language Nehirawewin or Nehilawewin (which is the Historical form of the word (see sources from the 1600 hundreds) and also uses the r in line with the above ideas.

I will also start contributing using the above rules in the near futur (I didnt even know this wikipidiya existed!).

: There is no standard dialect, nor is it appropriate for Wikipedia contributors to engineer one. Furthermore, a term like ''nēhilawēwin'' wouldn't make sense at all. In Moose Cree, for example, the term for the language is based on a different root: ''ililīmowin''. And the Atikamekw dialect (which uses ''r'') is politically distinct from Cree so using ''r's'' for Cree would be most unusual. Some SRO texts I've seen use an acute-accented y to indicate the phoneme which undergoes y-n-th-l variation. [[User:Languagegeek|Languagegeek]] 02:47, 8 July 2011 (UTC)

: : Actually Nehilawewin does make sense and is used by the speakers of the Piyekwâkamiy dialect in Quebec. And concerning Atikamekw - two dialects exist, one in which the 'l' is very common and resembles Moose Cree immensely. Are we concerned about political associations or writing in a language that we can all understand? Let us keep in mind that political associations do not match up perfectly with dialectal realities. Monolingual elders don't have these problems because for the most part they are multi-dialectal speakers and they don't get caught up in ethnic terms popularized by the English and French. If we cannot at least attempt to write in a widely understood dialect then we need to accept that this will ONLY be a PLAINS CREE wikipedia and not a CREE wikipedia - this would be the ONLY argument for only using the term Nehiyawewin and writing in that dialect only. Every other Cree dialect will have to set up its own wikipedia.

Kevin B. Aug. 2, 2011
:::Setting up another diffrent cree wikipedia is not an option. For example, the Inuktitut wikipedia who has way more articles than this wikipedia has just been proposed for deletion, however, I'm pretty sure the decision will be to keep it open, but that's just to show you that we are not in a position of dividing the cree wikipedia. That being said, if the different dialects are a real issue, nothing refrain us of creating multiple articles in different dialects (i.e. same subject in different dialects on different pages). For the name of language for the title of the Wikipedia and the interwikis on the other languages wikipedias, we need to find a word that make sense in all (or most) dialects. [[User:Amqui|Amqui]] 05:53, 6 August 2011 (UTC)

== Dialect ==

This wikipedia is labelled as Nehiyawewin, the Plains or 'Y' dialect.  As you move further east, the Cree dialects diverge a fair amount, though are still generally intelligible.  However, if we start including Anishnabe or other Algonkian languages, we get further and further away from actual Nehiyawewin.

I'm suggesting we try to stick with Nehiyawewin in the main, either in RSO or in syllabics.  Since it probably isn't feasible to have a separate wikipedia for every dialect of Cree (yet), then having articles in those other dialects would be fine...but what if we have a specific section for those articles?  A section just for the TH, N etc dialects?  Part of the benefit of developing this wikipedia is to provide language resources to those who are trying to gain more fluency.  If we waffle between dialects we might harm more than we help.  

I'm going to work on updating the main page to reflect a Nehiyawewin focus, and I'll reorganise the existing articles in other dialects so they can still be accessed.  If later on, this is challenged, I have no problem with a reversion, but it's a discussion that needs more than one person to engage in :D [[User:Yiwahikanak|Yiwahikanak]] 17:28, 2 April 2008 (UTC)

== ᓀᐦᐃᔭᐤ or ᓀᐦᐃᔭᐍᐏᐣ? ==

When I look at the main-main page of wikipedia http://www.wikipedia.org, I notice that the Cree language is labelled "Nēhiyaw / ᓀᐦᐃᔭᐤ". According to several Plains Cree dictionaries, Nēhiyaw / ᓀᐦᐃᔭᐤ  means "a Cree person". The term for the language is Nēhiyawēwin / ᓀᐦᐃᔭᐍᐏᐣ. The dictionaries are: Wolfart & Ahenakew’s "The Student’s Dictionary of Literary Plains Cree” and LeClaire & Cardinal’s “Alberta Elders’ Cree Dictionary”. Can we change the language label to Nēhiyawēwin / ᓀᐦᐃᔭᐍᐏᐣ? Also, I wonder what the policy is for languages with no officially sanctioned dialect. Wikipedia’s using the Plains Cree name, but there are quite a few variants: ᓀᐦᐃᔭᐍᒧᐏᐣ, ᓀᐦᐃᖬᐍᐏᐣ, ᐃᓂᓃᒧᐏᐣ, ᐃᓂᓂᐎ ᐃᔑᑭᔗᐎᐣ, ᐃᓕᓖᒧᐎᓐ, ᐄᔨᔫ ᐊᔨᒨᓐ, ᐄᓅ ᐊᔨᒨᓐ.

:I'm afraid this is partly my fault.  I believe the label was originally "Nehiyaw", which I naïvely suggested should be rendered with proper diacritics and in the syllabary as "Nēhiyaw / ᓀᐦᐃᔭᐤ".  I didn't think to actually use the correct term.  (D'oh!)  The proper place to report it is on Wikimedia's Bugzilla, and specifically at [http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=5452 Bug 5452].

:With respect to which dialect to use, for the article texts it doesn't matter so long as the dialects are mutually intelligible.  (If they're not, then separate wikis are warranted.)  For the user interface texts (including the logo), I don't know if there's a policy, but the best place to find out if there is one is to ask on [[meta:Main page|Meta]]. I expect the most sensible thing to do is to choose the dialect which has the largest number of speakers, or the greatest amount of literature. —[[User:ᓰᑯᓇᐅᐟ|ᓰᑯᓇᐅᐟ]] 23:13, 26 February 2007 (UTC)

About the idea of a standard dialect, see the topic at the top of this page. It is important that dialects at the far ends of the continuum arent used since these are unintelligible to people at the other of end of the dialect continuum. I suggest above that a medium be used, a dialect similar to Moose Cree of Atikamekw for purposes of phonology, but supplanted with ones own vocabulary. This should be quite interesting in itself since it would encourage us all to learn vocabulary from various dialects.

Ideally, contributors would be using both syllabics and standard roman orthography, but I know for myself, I don't yet have a grasp of the syllabics, so I'm going to be sticking with the SRO for now.  I also think we need to be using both in any case, because depending on where you live, syllabics may or may not be used.  I will be making contributions in the Y dialect, and using Albertan macrons (âîô) as well as 'h' joiners instead of hyphens.

== Dialects ==

Since Cree comprises different dialects, I think we should create sub-sections on this Wiki for each of them. Only the main ones (i.e. the one that are not understandable between each other) should have their own section (I know there is sub-dialect inside those main ones, but in those cases,  I think we should just pick one for a given article, like on the English Wikipedia where some articles use British orthograph and others American). I have started a draft of a new Main Page to sort those out : [[User:Amqui/Main page]]. Please give me your feedback on that. What we need to do now is to sort out the existing articles by the dialect they are written in. This can be done by putting them in the appropriate dialect category (those categories also need to be created, example <nowiki>[[Category:Naskapi]], [[Category:Plains Cree]]</nowiki>, etc.. but should have the title in their respective dialect). Next, we have two options: creating articles in a single dialect and we can have two different articles on the same subject written in two differents dialects, or include all dialects in the same page in different sections (with redirections from the different titles), what do you think ?

Étant donné que la langue crie comprend différents dialectes, je crois que nous devrions créer des sous-sections sur ce Wiki pour chacun d'eux. Seulement les principaux (i.e. ceux qui ne sont intelligibles entre eux) devraient avoir leur propre section (je sais qu'il y a des sous-dialectes dans les principaux, mais pour ceux-ci, je crois que nous devrions seulement en choisir un pour un article donné, comme sur le Wikipédia en anglais où l'orthographe britannique est utilisée pour certains articles et américaine pour d'autres). J'ai commencé une ébauche pour une nouvelle page d'accueil pour trier les dialectes : [[User:Amqui/Main page]]. Veuillez me donner vos avis sur celle-ci. Ce que nous devons faire maintenant est de trier les articles existants selon le diaclecte dans lesquels ils sont écrits. Cela peut être fait en les mettant dans la catégorie de dialecte appropriée (ces catégories sont aussi à créer, exemple <nowiki>[[Category:Naskapi]], [[Category:Plains Cree]]</nowiki>, etc.. mais elles devraient avoir un titre dans le dialecte respectif). Ensuite, nous avons deux options : créer les articles dans un seul dialecte et nous pouvons avoir deux articles sur le même sujet écrit dans deux dialectes différents ou bien inclure tous les dialectes dans la même page dans des sections différentes (avec des redirections à partir des différents titres), qu'en pensez-vous ?

: Bonjour! C'est une exellente idée de trier les articles sur la page principale selon les dialectes!

== Articles in two different languages having the same title ==
There are words that have the same orthography even though it's two different languages. Example: Atikmw means "dog" in East Cree and in Atikamekw. How can we differ these articles? The problem is, that the Cree "dialects" (languages) have one portal together what means that it's not shown as "East Cree" / "Atikamekw" but as Nēhiyawēwin / ᓀᐦᐃᔭᐍᐏᐣ. So we have two articles written in two different languages which are both presented as "Nēhiyawēwin / ᓀᐦᐃᔭᐍᐏᐣ" under "Other languages". [[User:Kiackw|Kiackw]], 14 June 2013

Il y a des mots qui ont la même orthographe bien que ce soit deux langues différentes. Par exemple: Atimw veut dire "chien" en cri de l'est et en atikamekw. Comment est-ce qu'on peut différencier ces articles-là? Le problème, c'est qu'on utilise un même portail pour les huit "dialectes" (langues) cri(e)s. Ca veut dire que "Wikipédia" ne fait pas la différence entre les huit langues et ne montre pas les articles comme "Cri de l'est" et "Atikamekw" mais tous les deux comme "Nēhiyawēwin / ᓀᐦᐃᔭᐍᐏᐣ". Donc, on a deux articles en deux langues différentes qui sont tous les deux montrés en "Nēhiyawēwin / ᓀᐦᐃᔭᐍᐏᐣ" au-dessous de "Autres langues". [[User:Kiackw|Kiackw]], 14 Juin 2013

Hi there. First off, not that any of my business, but I'm not sure if a wiki with 20 active users needs a fully protected main page. Meta (3,000 active users), Wikidata (10,000 active users), and several other sites do just fine without it. Regardless... ''Labardor'' -> ''Labrador'', please. Thanks.

:Done, as [[m:GS|global sysop]]. Should I ask [[User:Amqui]], the local sysop who happens to be a [[m:S|steward]], to unprotect it? I technically can do so, but global sysops aren't supposed to interfere (read: potentially disrupt) with the communities.

::Sounds like a good idea. Thanks! Feel free to ping me again if Amqui or anyone else would like a more detailed rationale.[[User:PinkAmpersand|PinkAmpersand]] ([[User talk:PinkAmpersand|talk]]) 02:02, 9 July 2013 (UTC)
:::Unprotected. Only because I monitor it often, your rationale is incorrect in my opinion, a project with more users have more users to check if somebody edit the mainpage incorrectly, while a project with less users may not if a visitor come and do the same, so it should be the inverse, or you should user the number of visitors instead of users maybe.

== The logo of this site ==

I propose that the logo of this site be changed to Cree letters. I don't speak a word of Cree but I believe that you may have to use different names depending on area:
*Plains/Swampy Cree: ᐏᑭᐱᑎᐊ (wi ki pi ti a, no D so substitute T)
*Woodland Cree: ᐏᑭᐲᑎᐊ (wi ki pii ti a)

== Global sysops ==

please lock up the main page, it is constantly spammed--[[Special:Contributions/176.104.110.11|176.104.110.11]] 21:41, 10 November 2015 (UTC)

== Cree is missing ==

== Cree Wikipedia is not for fun of non-speakers ==
Cree wikipedia should be a useful tool for Cree speakers and not a game in the hands of non-speakers --[[User:HacheDous&#61;0|HacheDous&#61;0]] ([[User talk:HacheDous&#61;0|talk]]) 12:05, 20 February 2022 (UTC)

:Well yes obviously but clearly there just isn’t an urgent demand or a sufficient number or fluent speakers who know how to type Cree. [[User:Dronebogus|Dronebogus]] ([[User talk:Dronebogus|talk]]) 17:31, 3 December 2022 (UTC)
